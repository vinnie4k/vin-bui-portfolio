          <h2>The Past</h2>
          <p>I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas for the past 18 years of my life. During high school, I took three years of computer science where I learned object-oriented programming and data structures with Java. I also took two years of Networking/IT and Cybersecurity where I learned how to set up and configure networks with routers, switches, servers, etc. I obtained several different certifications from Microsoft, CompTIA, and Cisco during my time there.</p>

          <h2>The Present</h2>
          <p>I am currently working on projects on my own time while balancing school work and my part-time job at Cornell Fitness Center. Aside from school and career-related projects, I enjoy live streaming video games on Twitch. I have been streaming for five years and look forward to it over the upcoming breaks. My current favorite hobby is working out at the gym and playing basketball. I started lifting weights a couple of months ago and really enjoy seeing the progress I am making.</p>

          <h2>The Future</h2>
          <p>I plan on applying to a project team at Cornell to learn what it means to be a part of a team and to improve my skills in this area. I really enjoy working with a group of passionate students because it provides me the opportunity to learn from other people. Another plan of mine is to apply to become an undergraduate TA for a computer science course at Cornell. I love sharing my personal experience from courses I have taken as well as using the knowledge I have gained to assist other students. One of my future goals at this moment is to secure an internship position at a company as a Software Engineer.</p>
